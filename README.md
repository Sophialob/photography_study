# Coping and help-seeking among of Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women living in the United Kingdom since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war

## Information sheet
We would like to invite you to take part in this PhD research study. Joining the study is entirely up to you. Before you decide if you would like to participate, you need to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve. Please  take your time to decide whether you would like to take part.  

#### What is the purpose of the study? 
This PhD project aims to explore coping and help-seeking among Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24 years old) living in the United Kingdom (UK) since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022. From this research, we hope to gain a better understanding of the challenges experienced by Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women living in the UK, how they cope and seek support for their mental health.

#### Why have I been asked to take part?
You have been invited to take part because you are a Ukrainian adolescent girl or young woman who has moved to the UK since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. Your participation and insights are extremely important. They would allow us to understand the mental health of young Ukrainian women living in the UK, how Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women cope, and where they go to for support.

#### Do I have to take part?
It is entirely your decision if you would like to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be asked to indicate your informed consent by ticking the boxes required before entering the study. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason, by emailing the researcher responsible for the project with your unique number code which will be provided to you on the survey platform. Your participation or withdrawal from the study will not affect any services or quality of services you receive. 

#### What will I have to do?
You will be asked to complete an online survey about your general health, coping strategies and types of support would consider seeking in different situations. The survey will take no longer than 15 minutes to complete. 

#### What are the possible risks and disadvantages? 
Some questions in the survey will be of sensitive nature (about your mental health) and so this study may not be suitable for those who are suffering from acute mental health problems (severe depression, severe anxiety or severe trauma). Some questions will also ask about your coping strategies, and somay not be suitable for those who have major problems with drugs or alcohol. We encourage you to discuss your potential participation in the study with someone before deciding if you would like to participate. If you are a minor (under the age of 18), we strongly encourage to discuss your participation with an adult. 

To ensure you feel supported, you will be provided with a list of  services that provide support to Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women in the UK and online. You may also contact the researcher responsible for the project at any time you have questions or feel distressed (Sophia Lobanov-Rostovsky, sophia.lobanov-rostovsky@lshtm.ac.uk).

#### What are the possible benefits? 
While we cannot promise the study will help you directly, the information we get will considerably help our knowledge and understanding of how Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women in the UK cope and seek support for their mental health. We hope the findings will help to inform the development of more effective interventions for Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women, and other young female refugee populations, in the UK. 

#### What if something goes wrong? 
If you have concerns about any aspect of this study, you should speak to the researcher responsible for the project who will do their best to answer your questions ( sophia.lobanov-rostovsky@lshtm.ac.uk).

You just need to email the researcher responsible for the project (sophia.lobanov-rostovsky@lshtm.ac.uk) and say that you don’t want to be in the study anymore, providing your unique identifier code which will be given to you when you start the survey. If you decide to withdraw you will be asked what you wish to happen to the data you have provided up to that point. If your data has not been analysed yet, it will be deleted immediately.
