    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> We would like to invite your child to take part in this PhD research study. Joining the study is entirely up to you. Before you decide if you would like them to participate, you need to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve. Please take your time to decide whether you would like your child to take part.</p>

    <h3>What is the purpose of the study? </h3>
    <p>This PhD project aims to explore coping and help-seeking among Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24 years old) living in the United Kingdom (UK) since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022. From this research, we hope to gain a better understanding of the challenges experienced by Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women living in the UK, how they cope and seek support for their mental health. </p>

    <h3>Why has my child been asked to take part?</h3>
   <p>Your child has been invited to take part because they are a Ukrainian adolescent girl or young woman who has moved to the UK since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. Your child’s participation and insights are extremely important. They would allow us to understand how Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women living in the UK cope and where they go to for support for their mental health.</p>

    <h3>Does my child have to take part?</h3>
  <p> It is entirely your decision if you would like your child to take part. If you do decide that they can take part, you will be asked to indicate your informed consent by signing and returning a consent form to the researcher responsible for the project (Sophia Lobanov-Rostovsky, sophia.lobanov-rostovsky@lshtm.ac.uk) via DocuSign. Your child will also be asked to sign an assent form, to confirm they agree to take part in the study, and return via DocuSign. If you have questions at any point, you can email these questions to the researcher responsible for the project. </p>
 <p> You can withdraw your child from the study at any time without giving a reason, by emailing the researcher responsible for the project.</p> 
    
  <h3>What will my child have to do?</h3>
  <p>Your child will be asked to join a total of five 90-minute workshops with other Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women. These will be held in-person, in West London. Attendance is required for all five sessions.</p>
  <p>Sessions will run every Saturday from 28th June to 26th July 2025. Outside of the workshop hours, your child will also be asked to take some photographs on the topics we will explore in the workshops using a smartphone. Sessions will focus on topics of coping, help-seeking and mental health support in your local area. Participation in the five sessions will take approximately 7.5 hours of your child’s time in total. All travel expenses will be reimbursed for their travel to and from the sessions if receipts are provided.</p>
  <p>Photographs chosen by your child and the other study group members may be displayed in a local community exhibition, to share their experiences with community members, service providers who provide mental health services, and policymakers.  The exhibition will aim to show how Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women in the UK cope, seek help and what support they would like. Sharing of photographs in an exhibition is completely optional, and your consent and your child’s assent will be asked for display of these photographs in the final workshop.  Photographs that your child takes during the study may also be published anonymously in a PhD thesis and any related publications, depending on your consent and your child’s assent.</p> 
 <p> If you consent, workshop discussions, of the photographs will be audio recorded.  These audio recordings will be deleted immediately after transcribing and translating them, within six months of the data being collected (by December 2025). There is a minimal risk that your child can be identifiable from these audio recordings, as all data from these audio recordings will be pseudonymised. This means that your child’s data will be labelled with a unique number code, without their name or any other identifiable information.</p> 

<h3> What are the possible risks and disadvantages? </h3>
    <p>This research will involve discussion of topics such as what resources your child uses to cope, places they seek support and ways in which they want services to improve in your local area. This study may therefore not be suitable for those who have major problems with drugs or alcohol, or who are suffering from acute mental health problems (severe depression, severe anxiety or severe trauma).</p>
    <p>As noted above, participants’ chosen photographs may be published anonymously in a PhD thesis and shared in a public exhibition. Sharing of the participant’s photographs in the public domain is entirely optional and is not a condition of taking part in the study.  Consent for these photographs to be shared will be obtained from you and the participant prior to this. If you consent to the photographs being shared, please consider that these photographs will be in the public domain and may be seen for years to come. Please also consider how the participant might feel in the future about their photographs being shared.</p> 
    <p> You and your child will be provided with a list of services that provide mental health and psychosocial support to Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women in the UK, in they would like extra support. A Ukrainian psychotherapist will also join all sessions and the photography exhibition. Your child can speak to her if they feel distressed or worried. You may contact the researcher responsible for the project at any point via email if you have questions or if your child feels distressed (Sophia Lobanov-Rostovsky, sophia.lobanov-rostovsky@lshtm.ac.uk).</p>
  
<h3> What are the possible benefits? </h3>
    <p> To compensate your child for their time, they will receive a £125 shopping voucher. While we cannot promise the study will help your child directly, the information we get will considerably help our knowledge and understanding of how Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women in the UK cope and seek support for their mental health. We hope that this research will help to inform the development of effective interventions for Ukrainian adolescent girls and young women, and other young female refugee populations, in the UK. </p>

<h3> What if something goes wrong? </h3>
<p> If you have a concern about any aspect of this study, you should ask to speak to the researcher responsible for the project who will do their best to answer your questions. If you remain unhappy and wish to complain formally, you can do this by contacting the head of research governance at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, using the email address rgio@lshtm.ac.uk.</p>

<h3> Can I change my mind about my child taking part?</h3>
<p> Yes, you can withdraw your child from the study at any time. You just need to email the researcher responsible for the project and say that you don’t want your child to be in the study anymore. If you decide to withdraw your child, you will be asked what you wish to happen to the data your child has provided up to that point. If your child’s data has not been analysed yet, it will be deleted immediately. However, if your child’s data has already been analysed, it may not be possible to delete it.</p>
 
<h3> What will happen to information collected about my child? </h3>
<p> The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is based in the UK and will act as the data controller for this study. This means that they are responsible for looking after your child’s information and using it properly.  To follow the UK’s data protection regulations, we must inform you of how we will use and store your child’s personal data. </p>

<p> All information we collect during this study will be kept confidential and there are strict laws which safeguard your and your child’s privacy at every stage:</p>
<p> 1. Only the researcher responsible for the project will have access to directly identifiable information which you provide in your consent form (your name, your child’s name, your child’s date of birth, your phone number and your email address), which will be stored on a secure online server. This identifiable information will be stored separately to the other study information and destroyed immediately after all analysis has been completed (expected to be April 2026). The only exception to this confidentiality is if the researcher hears anything which makes them worried that someone might be in danger of harm. According to UK law, the researcher might have to inform relevant agencies of this.</p>
<p> 2. Pseudonymised findings from this project may be shared with the project team (project supervisors, youth advisors, the Ukrainian psychotherapist and translators). This data will be coded with a unique number (not your child’s name or any other personal information). Examples include a summary of themes across all participants, some anonymous quotes from the workshops or photographs that your child takes and consents to being shared. These findings may be published in a PhD thesis which will be available in the public domain. This data will also be archived in the UK Data Service and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine data repository. The data will be made available to other researchers worldwide for 10 years after completion of the overall project (March 2027). No directly identifiable information will be included, so there is a minimal risk that you or your child can be identified.</p>

<h3> What are your choices about how my child’s information is used?</h3>
<p> We need to manage your child’s records in specific ways for the research to be reliable. This means we won’t be able to let you see or change the data we hold.</p>

<h3> Where can you find out more about how my child’s information is used?</h3>
<p> You can find out more about how we use your information</p>
•	At https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/files/research-participant-privacy-notice.pdf 
•	by asking one of the research team
•	by sending an email to DPO@lshtm.ac.uk 

<h3> What will happen to the results of this study? </h3>
<p> The study results will be published in a PhD thesis upon completion of the overall project (March 2027) and in peer-reviewed academic journals to allow other researchers and policymakers to learn from them. Your identifiable information, and that of your child, will not be included in the study publications, so there will be a minimal risk that you or your child can be identified.</p>

<h3> Who is organising and funding this study? </h3>
<p> This study is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, which is the largest funder of economic, social, behavioural and human data science in the UK. The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine has full responsibility for the project including the collection, storage and analysis of your data and your child’s data, and will act as the Data Controller for the study.</p>  

<h3> Who has reviewed this study? </h3>
<p> All research involving human participants is looked at by an independent group of people, called a Research Ethics Committee, to protect your interests and your child’s interests. This study has been reviewed and accepted by The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (<ref:>). </p>   

<h3> Further information and contact details </h3>
<p> Thank you for taking time to read this information. If you think you would like your child to take part in the study, please email the researcher responsible for the project, Sophia Lobanov-Rostovsky (sophia.lobanov-rostovsky@lshtm.ac.uk) with your interest and confirming your child's eligibility for the study: your child is (1) a Ukrainian female (2) 15-24 years old (3) lived in Ukraine before February 2022 and (4) currently lives in the UK. She will then ask you to complete a consent form. She will also ask for your child to complete an assent form and return both documents to her via DocuSign over email. You will then be contacted by email or phone to with details of the first workshop on 28th June 2025.</p>
